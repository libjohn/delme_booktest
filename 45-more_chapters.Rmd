# Tables are fun {#intro}

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
```


Tables can be a challenge to render

## Paged tables are interactive but only work in .nb.html or unless specailly contructed

```{r}
starwars
```

## non-interactive

Old school, BUT easily cross functional with PDF and HTML alike

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

## Great Tables

the [`gt` package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is awesome but doesn't work in PDF

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(1:8) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 8) %>% 
  gt()
```



None of this was based on a book by John Little [@Little2018].
